# [TDD MOOC](https://tdd.mooc.fi): Full-stack web app

This is a project template for writing a full-stack web app. Here is just some basic Docker and Nginx configuration. The
rest is up to you. Just develop everything using TDD.

You should use the [walking skeleton](https://tdd.mooc.fi/5-advanced#walking-skeleton) approach to start
developing the application. Even this project template, empty though it may be, was done that way.

Focus on writing tests on every level of the stack:

- unit tests to cover as much of the code as is possible to unit test
- also unit test the user interface components (visual testing is optional)
- focused integration tests for the database and API layers
- one (1) end-to-end test against a fully deployed application (e.g. Docker containers running locally) to make sure
  that things are connected correctly (start with this -
  see [walking skeleton](https://tdd.mooc.fi/5-advanced#walking-skeleton))

_This exercise is part of the [TDD MOOC](https://tdd.mooc.fi) at the University of Helsinki, brought to you
by [Esko Luontola](https://twitter.com/EskoLuontola) and [Nitor](https://nitor.com/)._

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and whatever other tools you decide to use.

## Developing

    docker compose up -d db

Build and start all containers

    docker compose up -d --build

Destroy all containers and data

    docker compose down

Run end-to-end tests

    npx cypress run

    npx cypress open
